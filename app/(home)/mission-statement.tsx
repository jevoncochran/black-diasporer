        Black Diasporer is a project that aims to forge connections among the
        different peoples and parts of the global black diaspora. It is a
        platform for shifting narratives through positive content, giving space
        and voice to communities that are too often stigmatized and
        invisibilized. Ultimately, the goal is to leverage story-telling and
        cultural exchange as a means to generate resources and opportunity in
        marginalized communities that need them the most.
